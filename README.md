# Data-Cleaning-with-Python

# Project Description
The project involves the analysis of a census dataset from a modest town in the United Kingdom. The census, conducted every ten years, serves the purpose of comparing demographics across the nation, providing accurate population statistics for better planning, policy development, and fund allocation by the government.

As part of a local government team, the objective is to make decisions regarding an unoccupied plot of land and determine where to invest resources. The initial steps include cleaning and analyzing the mock census data to extract valuable insights that will inform the decision-making process. This analysis may involve examining population demographics, socio-economic factors, and other relevant variables to guide informed choices on land use and resource allocation within the town. The ultimate goal is to contribute to effective planning and development strategies based on the data-driven understanding of the town's characteristics.
Exploratory Data Analysis with Visualizations utilising Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, seaborn and Matplot.
